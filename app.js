// Create a ship class


// Create a human ship sub-class

// Create an alien ship sub-class

// Make an instance of each class

// Simulate a battle between the ship and a single alien ship

// Make a method for the USS Assembly that will attack a given target.
//  Target can be an input to a method



// Run the method and pass it throuh the alien ship

// Make it so the method reduces the target's hull by the firepower of the USS Asembly.



// Make a game OBJECT

// Make a method in the game OBJECT that will run a "check win" for the health of the aliens and the USS Assembly if the hull is 0 or less, display a message that the ship went kalboo-ey


// Make it so the alien will only be hit if a Math.random call is below the accuracy threshold.


// Make a method for the alien ship to attack a target


// Add a status console log for the end of the round


// If the alien ship goes Kabloo-ey, then the alien should not be able to attack you


// Make it so the attacks will keep occuring until someone's hull is at 0. Isolate what it is that you want to repeat.


// Make many alien ships with a Class. Make each object slightly different


// The hull should be between 3 and 6, firepower between 2 and 4, and the accuracy between 0.6 and 0.8


// CLUE/ANSWER
this.hull = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 3;
this.firepower = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2;
this.accuracy = (Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 6) / 10;

// Make a loop that calls the Class and generates alien ships.
// Push those constructed objects into a predefined array.
// Start with 6 ships (the loop should run 6 times)

// Move functions into the game object
